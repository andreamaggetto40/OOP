# Object Oriented Programming

The last decades have been subject to a considerable increase and enhancement of the OOP, nowadays considered one of the most remarkable Programming paradigms for Software Development.

Through **Java**, this repository's goal is to best showcase the main and the most advanced features of this prominent paradigm. 

Some of them cover:

- **Polymorphism**: The three ways an object can be dispatched to other forms.
- **Pseudo Functional Programming**: Recently Java introduced a new way to consider functions: as a value.
- **Comparator vs Comparable**: Some hands-on examples of how to sort any object kind.
- **Wildcards**: Closely related to the above point, Wildcards allow using a larger class of objects at once.
- **Design Patterns**: An in-depth study into **Iterator**, **Command** and **Singleton** patterns.
